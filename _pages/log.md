title: Jonathan Thompson's IMMERSE Log
---

### Week 1: April 26, 2021

* **Monday**: Linux Tutorial and Computer and Website setup.
* **Tuesday**: Read accelerated FPGA Aging Article and RapidWright Docs. Added immerse log link to bootcamp site. Started RapidWright Setup.
* **Wednesday**: Practiced using RapidWright and Vivado together on Lesson1 example. Went to Immerse meetings. Met with Broader Impact group.
* **Thursday**: Practiced git and set up and practiced RapidWright.
* **Friday**: Practiced creating shorts using RapidWright and programming them to an FPGA. 

### Week 2: May 3, 2021

* **Monday**: Worked on making voting shorts in one site and voting shorts in two sites on the same tile.
* **Tuesday**: Made a voting short with four signals and checked all possible outcomes.
* **Wednesday**: Worked on connecting a flip flop to the clock. Went to Immerse presentations and meetings as well as the bootcamp meeting on Make.
* **Thursday**: Figured out how to connect the clock to a flip flop. Started working on connecting switches to the inputs of a voting short.
* **Friday**: Worked on connecting switches to the inputs of voting shorts and creating functions that will work with shorts containing 2-6 signals. Went to bootcamp class on CMake.

### Week 3: May 10, 2021

* **Monday**: Worked on broader impact group project of helping to make a new lab for ECEn 301. Worked on getting the clock to connect to two sites in the same tile. Went to bootcamp class on python.
* **Tuesday**: Figured out how to connect the clock to the two sites within the same tile. Started reading up on readback. Made some adjustments to my website.
* **Wednesday**: Went to Immerse and bootcamp meetings. Practiced using python and learned how to setup and use venv and miniconda. Started trying to get readback to work with the voting shorts.
* **Thursday**: Worked on getting readback to work properly. Went to FPGA aging meeting.
* **Friday**: Worked on connecting readback to voting shorts. Went to bootcamp meeting about python packages.

### Week 4: May 17, 2021

* **Monday**: Got readback to work properly with voting shorts. Started modifying the existing readback parser file for our projects needs. Went to bootcamp meeting.
* **Tuesday**: Worked on writing tcl file to open vivado and create readback file. Wrote Immerse Proposal paper. Applied information taught in bootcamp by working on CVS_Parser. 
* **Wednesday**: Went to Immerse and Bootcamp meetings. Worked on writing a script for voting shorts. Started making a checkpoint file with voting shorts across the entire board.
* **Thursday**: Went to FPGA aging meeting. Worked on creating a checkpoint with voting shorts on the entire board.
* **Friday**: Worked on getting checkpoint of all voting shorts. Went to bootcamp meeting on docker. Worked on setting up computer for remote work.

### Week 5: May 24, 2021

* **Monday**: Worked on getting readback to work with the checkpoint of voting shorts on all the even row tiles on the board. Went to the FPGA deep dive Bootcamp meeting. Worked on setting up a vnc.
* **Tuesday**: Got X11 forwarding to work to allow remote work. Figured out how to use readback with the checkpoints that have voting shorts on the entire board. Used readback to get the output of all the voting shorts for each possible input for the 6 way voting shorts. Started working on displaying data in graph form.
* **Wednesday**: Worked on creating graphs to display the data on the outputs of the voting shorts. Went to Immerse and Bootcamp meetings. 
* **Thursday**: Finished making the graphs about the voting shorts outputs. Went to FPGA aging meeting. 
* **Friday**: Worked on selfpaced Bootcamp FPGA tcl activities and started making a new voting short bitstream.
